whenever i miss my girl so much and i am free (no class), i will drop her to her office, and i usually i go to [alfa x jatiwaringin](https://goo.gl/maps/NMpCY1ATJvvLHKQa6) to wait until she finishes work, but i am bored and want to explore kelapa gading! so I was looking for a comfortable cafe to work late into the night, and I found a cafe called [MAXX COFFEE](https://goo.gl/maps/L43mTdv2kMJF9AVK6), it's in Kelapa Gading, a little straight from my girl's office, this cafe is really comfortable, the wifi is fast, the drinks are delicious, and the music is my taste hahaha. my rating is 4.5/5 because perfection belongs to Allah alone
